# Android Project

## Project Brief

Creating an android task list app.

## Description

This is an SWL back-end and Java logic android application. Focus was on implementing Java on mobile platforms.

This functional application remains in use and provides basic note-taking functionality. Due to its small memory and processing requirements it has served as a far more compact and efficient way of taking daily notes than previously used solutions.

### To Run Follow
